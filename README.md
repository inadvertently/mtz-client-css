# mtz-client-css
mtz is a krunker.io client that's users **must** download in order to use. Oops not anymore

- Use any extension that allows you to implement Custom CSS for a website. Highly recommend **User CSS**

- Paste the code into wherever it asks you to or simply import the file.

- Set the website you're using it for "Krunker.io"

Now you're set to go. Keep in mind as the game goes through updates, things might start to get messed up as the code will start to outdate.
