# mtz-client-css
Fairly simple source for a clean, sleek GUI on krunker

- Use any extension that allows you to implement Custom CSS for a website. Highly recommend **User CSS**

- Paste the code into wherever it asks you to or simply import the file.

- Set the website you're using it for "Krunker.io"

Now you're set to go. Keep in mind as the game goes through updates, the code will also become messy as coordinates and sizes for buttons may change.
